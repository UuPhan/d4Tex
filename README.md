## Simple script and plugin for reading textures in Diablo IV
### How to use:
1. Clone this git to your device
2. Copy textures from game that you want to read into corresponding folders. *(Must have both meta & payload for a same filename)*
3. Run `process.py` python script in command line i.e: `py process.py`
4. Copy `fmt_diablo4_tex.py` file to Noesis plugins folder

### Disclamer:
This script very simple and may not reading every files. Still need bugs tracking and improve. Any contributes and issues report are welcome
